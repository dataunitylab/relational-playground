[Relational Playground](https://relationalplayground.com/) is developed by the [Data Unity Lab](https://cs.rit.edu/~dataunitylab/) at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### `pnpm flow`

Type check all files in the `src` folder using [Flow](https://flow.org/).
This check will also be run before commits.

### `pnpm lint`

Lint all files in `src` using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
Files which have changed are also linted before every commit.
